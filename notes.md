### Important questions to ask about ML process/results
- How did you build it? If it needs data to learn, remember: Garbage in, garbage out. Bias in, bias out.5
- How did you test it? Is it doing what you expect?
- Does it work? Have you got a solution to your problem?
- What parameters did you use? Are these good enough or will something else work better?
- Does it apply generally? Or does it only work for your current problem and data?

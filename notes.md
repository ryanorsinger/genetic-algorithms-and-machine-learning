### Important questions to ask about ML process/results
- How did you build it? If it needs data to learn, remember: Garbage in, garbage out. Bias in, bias out.5
- How did you test it? Is it doing what you expect?
- Does it work? Have you got a solution to your problem?
- What parameters did you use? Are these good enough or will something else work better?
- Does it apply generally? Or does it only work for your current problem and data?

### Decision trees
- Once you have a decision tree, youâ€™ll turn it into a ruleset and prune it back to locate the paper bag...
- type of classifier
- use domain knowledge and entropy to guide the tree's growth
- classification trees (categorical)
- regression trees (numerical)
- ask a question and take a branch depending on the answer
